\section{Future work}

The Nail parser generator is work in progress and feedback of all sorts is heavily
encouraged. Source code is available upon request and will be released publicly pending clean-up and
maturity. Short-term future work will include improving the scoping of dependency fields and adding
support for offset fields.

A major problem with the current design of Nail is that the design of the grammar dictates the
interna structure of the software. This makes changing grammars or adding Nail to existing software
awkward. One possible solution to this problem would be to implement a concept similar to Relational
Lenses \cite{bohannon2006relational}, which would allow  the data model to be 'seen' by
the rest of the program through an isomorphism. Such an isomorphism would still be much more concise
than two sets of semantic actions, while allowing changes in syntax, alternative representations
and adaption to legacy systems.

Finally, we would like to demonstrate the capabilities of Nail by implementing various binary
formats 'notorious' for their insecurity in Nail. Nail was designed with the idioms of formats such
as PDF and PNG in mind. Ultimately, we want to provide examples of successful Nail parsers all
throughout a network stack - from a user-space TCP stack to a PNG de-compressor.
