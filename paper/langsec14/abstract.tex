\begin{abstract}

We present \textit{Nail}, an interface generator that allows programmers
to safely parse and generate protocols defined by a Parser-Expression
based grammar. Nail uses a richer set of parser combinators that
induce an internal representation, obviating the need to write semantic
actions. Nail also provides solutions parsing common patterns such as
length and offset fields within binary formats that are hard to process
with existing parser generators.
