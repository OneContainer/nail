\section{Evaluation}
In order to test the Nail framework, we cloned the test DNS server from the Hammer distribution to
Nail. Hammer ships with a toy DNS server written in 683 lines of code, excluding the hammer
framework itself that responds to any valid DNS query with a CNAME record to the domain
``spargelze.it''.  Most of this code is taken up with custom validators, semantic actions and data
structure definitions. 

Our DNS server measures 148 lines of C and 48 lines of Nail grammar, and supports a custom zone file format
with A,NS,MX and CNAME records. The same grammar is used together with 98 lines of C to implement a
functional toy clone of the host command line tool. However, because our grammar does not yet
support DNS label compression, the latter tool will occasionally reject valid real world DNS
responses. Both clients have functional anti-spoofing measures.

It is hard to compare our efforts to a real world DNS server, as we have less functionality, in
particular for DNS compression and additional hint records than real world DNS servers. 
However, the closest in functionality and intent is Dan Bernstein's djbdns\footnote{\url{http://cr.yp.to/djbdns.html}}, which aims
to be a minimalist, highly secure DNS server. The latest release of DJBDNS, however, including
various support tools is about ten thousand lines of C as measured by SLOCCOUNT. We are confident
that it is possible to a feature-par version with Nail that is an order of magnitude smaller and
intend to do so.
