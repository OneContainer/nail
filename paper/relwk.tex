Generating parsers and generators from an executable specification
is the core concept of Interface Generators, e.g. in CORBA or more
recently~\cite{varda2008}. However, while interface generators work
very well for existing grammars, they do not allow full control over the
format of the output, so cannot be used to implement legacy protocols.
Very related work has been done at Bell Labs with the PacketTypes
system~\cite{mccann2000packet}, however PacketTypes works only as a
parser, not as an output generator and does not support the expressive
power of PEGs, but rather implements a C like structure model enhanced
with data-dependent length fields and constraints.
