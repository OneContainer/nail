\section{Conclusion}
\label{s:concl}

This paper presented the initial design and implementation of
\textit{Nail}, an interface generator for data formats.  Nail helps
programmers to avoid memory corruption and ambiguity vulnerabilities
while reducing effort in parsing and generating real-world protocols
and file formats.  Nail achieves this by reducing the expressive
power of the grammar, maintaining a \emph{semantic bijection} between
data formats and internal representations, and allowing programmers to
specify \emph{structural dependencies} in the data format.  Preliminary
experience with implementing a DNS server using Nail suggests that this
is a promising approach.
